## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What This Is
An interactive, narrative-driven web experience that shows why early cancer detection matters — through the lens of a relatable patient story.

### Why It Exists
- **Pitch meetings:** Demo on laptop, create emotional connection investors remember
- **Website:** Engaging content that keeps visitors longer than a static deck
- **Education:** Help people understand the problem HelioFlux solves
- **Differentiation:** Most biotech sites are boring; this stands out

### The Goal
Make people FEEL the gap between "let's watch it" and "it's too late" — then show how HelioFlux fills that gap.

### Target Audience
1. **Investors** — angels, family offices, VCs interested in biotech
2. **Clinical partners** — hospitals, dermatology practices, research institutions
3. **General public** — people who might one day need this technology

---

## 💡 THE CORE INSIGHT

### The Real Problem (Behavioral)
Most patients don't skip care because they don't care. They skip because:
- The next step is **expensive**
- The next step is **invasive** (biopsy scars, blood draws)
- The next step is **slow** (weeks of waiting)
- The next step is **uncertain** (probably nothing, but maybe not?)

This creates a deadly default path:
```
Notice something → Delay → "Let's watch it" → Busy life → Return when it's worse
```

### The HelioFlux Solution
A quick, non-invasive scan that can help clinicians decide sooner — while the lesion is still small.

**HelioFlux exists for the gap between "let's watch it" and "it's too late."**

### Key Messaging Points

| Message | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| "The Gap Nobody Solves" | Hook — identifies the problem |
| "'Let's watch it' is not bad medicine" | Respects clinicians, doesn't blame them |
| "It's what happens when tools are limited" | Positions HelioFlux as enabling, not replacing |
| "Detect metabolic change earlier, when clinicians are still deciding what to do" | Precise, responsible claim |
| "Quick enough to actually happen" | Addresses the behavioral barrier |

## 👩 MAYA'S STORY

### Why Maya (Not Sarah)
The original version used "Sarah" — a patient with family history, representing the "high risk" population. But that's actually a small slice of patients.

**Maya represents the majority:**
- No family history
- Not "high risk" by any metric
- Just a regular person who noticed something and delayed

This is more universal and hits the real behavioral bottleneck.

### Maya's Character Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Age | Not specified (relatable to 30-60 range) |
| Risk factors | None — no family history |
| Trigger | Friend had melanoma years ago |
| Initial symptom | Small change on skin |
| Why she delays | It's a hassle; probably nothing |
| At the doctor | Doesn't want biopsy scar |
| Doctor's response | "Let's watch it" |
| What happens | Life gets busy, months pass |
| Outcome (traditional) | Returns when it's worse |
| Outcome (HelioFlux) | Gets clarity sooner, clear follow-up plan |

### The Narrative Arc

```
RELATABLE TRIGGER → UNDERSTANDABLE DELAY → REASONABLE MEDICAL ADVICE → 
LIFE HAPPENS → CONSEQUENCES → [WHAT IF THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY?]
```

### Story Text (Exact Copy)

**Screen 1 - Intro:**
> Most patients don't skip care because they don't care.
> They skip because the next step is expensive, invasive, slow, or uncertain.

**Screen 2 - Meet Maya:**
> Maya has no family history. She's not a "high-risk" person.
> 
> A friend had melanoma a few years back. That planted a seed — weird spots can be serious.
> 
> Maya notices a small change on her skin. She delays because it's a hassle.

**Screen 3 - The Wait:**
> When Maya finally goes in, she doesn't want a biopsy scar for something that's probably nothing.
> 
> The dermatologist says, "Let's watch it."
> 
> So she watches it. Life gets busy. Months pass.
> 
> Then it changes enough that she can't ignore it. She goes back.
> 
> Now it's worse.

**Screen 4 - The Default Path:**
> Notice something → Delay → "Let's watch it" → Busy life → Return when it's worse
> 
> The real failure point is the wait: watchful waiting plus human delay.

**Screen 5 - The HelioFlux Path:**
> Notice something → Quick, non-invasive scan → Earlier clarity → Earlier action
> 
> "Let's watch it" is not bad medicine. It's what happens when the tools are limited. HelioFlux gives doctors a better tool in the watch window.

**Screen 6 - Scale Comparison:**
> 1 Billion Cells — Traditional detection threshold
> 10 Million Cells — HelioFlux detection target
> 
> 100x earlier detection. While clinicians are still deciding what to do.

**Screen 7 - Technology:**
> Every cell emits ultra-weak photons. The pattern changes when cells change.
> 
> The HelioFlux advantage: detect metabolic change earlier, when clinicians are still deciding what to do.

**Screen 8 - Maya's Outcome:**
> With HelioFlux, Maya doesn't wait months in uncertainty.
> She gets a clear follow-up plan — sooner.
> 
> HelioFlux exists for the gap between "let's watch it" and "it's too late."

## 📱 SCREEN-BY-SCREEN CONTENT

### Screen 1: The Gap Nobody Solves
**Purpose:** Hook with the core insight

**Visual:** Dark background, floating biophoton particles

**Headline:** "The Gap Nobody Solves"

**Body:** Most patients don't skip care because they don't care. They skip because the next step is expensive, invasive, slow, or uncertain.

**CTA:** "See What We Mean"

---

### Screen 2: Meet Maya
**Purpose:** Introduce relatable character

**Visual:** Simple avatar (warm earth tones), friendly but not photo-realistic

**Headline:** "Maya's Story"

**Body:** 
- No family history, not "high-risk"
- Friend had melanoma → planted a seed
- Notices small skin change
- Delays because it's a hassle

**CTA:** "Continue"

---

### Screen 3: The Wait
**Purpose:** Build tension, show the delay pattern

**Headline:** "The Wait"

**Body:**
- Doesn't want biopsy scar for "probably nothing"
- Doctor says "Let's watch it"
- Life gets busy, months pass
- Returns when it's worse

**Emotional beat:** The line "Now it's worse" should hit hard (styled in red/danger color)

**CTA:** "See the Pattern"

---

### Screen 4: The Default Path
**Purpose:** Visualize the broken system

**Headline:** "The Default Path"

**Visual:** Animated flow diagram (steps appear one by one)

```
Notice something
      ↓
    Delay
      ↓
"Let's watch it"
      ↓
  Busy life
      ↓
Return when it's worse  ← (highlighted in red)
```

**Key message:** "The real failure point is the wait: watchful waiting plus human delay."

**CTA:** "There's a Better Path"

---

### Screen 5: The HelioFlux Path
**Purpose:** Show the solution

**Headline:** "The HelioFlux Path"

**Visual:** Animated flow diagram (teal/green colors)

```
Notice something
      ↓
Quick, non-invasive scan  ← (highlighted in teal)
      ↓
Earlier clarity
      ↓
Earlier action  ← (highlighted in green)
```

**Quote block:**
> "Let's watch it" is not bad medicine.
> It's what happens when the tools are limited. HelioFlux gives doctors a better tool in the watch window.

**CTA:** "See the Scale"

---

### Screen 6: Real-Scale Cell Comparison
**Purpose:** Make the 100x difference visceral

**Headline:** "To Scale: When Detection Happens"

**Visual:** Two circles, proportionally sized by AREA

| Circle | Diameter | Represents |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Large (red) | 220px | 1 billion cells (traditional) |
| Small (green) | 22px | 10 million cells (HelioFlux) |

**Math:** 
- Ratio: 1,000,000,000 / 10,000,000 = 100x
- Area scales with radius²
- So diameter ratio = √100 = 10x
- If small = 22px, large = 220px

**Note below visualization:** "Circle areas are proportional to cell counts. This is real scale."

**Key message:** "100x earlier detection. While clinicians are still deciding what to do."

**CTA:** "How It Works"

## ⚖️ LEGAL & COMPLIANCE

### Safe Language (Use These)

- ✅ "Aims to detect"
- ✅ "Detection target"
- ✅ "In development"
- ✅ "Based on peer-reviewed research"
- ✅ "Published in iScience"
- ✅ "Potential to transform"
- ✅ "Non-invasive"
- ✅ "Quick scan"
- ✅ "Earlier clarity"
- ✅ "Clear follow-up plan"

### Avoid (Don't Use)

- ❌ "FDA approved"
- ❌ "Cures cancer"
- ❌ "Diagnoses cancer"
- ❌ "Saved her life"
- ❌ Specific accuracy percentages (pending clinical trials)
- ❌ "Guaranteed" anything
- ❌ "100% accurate"
- ❌ Implying HelioFlux replaces doctor judgment

### Required Disclaimer

Include on final screen:
> HelioFlux is currently in development. Based on peer-reviewed research. Not yet FDA approved. Intended for investigational use only.

### Maya's Outcome (Responsible Framing)

**Good:** "She gets a clear follow-up plan — sooner."

**Bad:** "HelioFlux saved her life" or "HelioFlux diagnosed her cancer."

The story shows the problem and the potential — it doesn't overclaim the solution.
